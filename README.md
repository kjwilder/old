## Obsolete but perhaps slightly historically interesting C++ code.
- I wrote all of this code circa 1996 after STL publication but prior to
  available implementations.
- The initial commit contains exact copies of the code I used in the 1990's.
- The latest commits contain code that should work with modern (as of 2022) C++
  compilers, not that anyone would want to use it.
