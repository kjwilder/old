## Obsolete somewhat historically interesting C++ code.
- I wrote these libraries circa 1996 but mostly switched to using STL
  implementations in the early 2000's.
- I wrote these libraries after g++ supported templates but before it had
  a good and widely available STL implementation.
- The initial commit contains exact copies of my working code from the 1990's.
  It will not compile with a modern C++ compiler.
- Later commits include tests and updates to make the code compile with newer
  compilers.
